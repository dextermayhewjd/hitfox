1st tutorial(hyperlink:https://youtu.be/zPZK7C5_BQo?t=1015) (17:00) timestamp
Launcher.cs(in tutorial) == PLayer.cs(in implementation + commented out prev code in this and UIManager.cs)
Made Canvas in scene to hold menu ( w 2 menus LoadingMenu and TitleMenu titles are self explanatory, should show loading then title but doesn't connect fully)

Err: "Can not instantiate before client joined/created a room State: PeerCreated"(possibly due to previous scripts as works in vid, tho it is not recent too) + does not switch from loading menu to title menu(possibly due to this error stopping execution)
Note: we could assign region to photon so users don't have to pick one(Assets>PhotonUnityNetwork>Resources>Photon Server Settings components) (vid picked USW as less ping) by changing Inspector Window of
Note2: found out with free version photon PUN can have max 20 players

follow the first two tutorial
basiclly realize the function of create room and find room with system generated user name

you could follow the 3&4&5 tutorial but not the sixth one
since it is related with the movement implementation of the player so it need to be talked with jaqob
